# L6 v1.0.0

## Liability (Level 6)

### 📌 Summary
Minimal liability with nominal caps, no warranties, extensive exclusions and disclaimers.

### 👤 What This Means For You
This liability structure is designed for experimental, beta, or community-supported services where comprehensive guarantees aren't feasible. The nominal liability cap reflects the experimental nature or low-cost model of these services. While we strive to provide value, the limited warranty acknowledges that experimental or donation-based services cannot promise the same reliability as premium offerings. This allows innovative services to exist that might not be viable under traditional liability models.

### 📜 Legal Text
Maximum aggregate liability shall not exceed the lesser of $50 or fees paid in the preceding month. Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. Provider's liability excludes: all categories of damages; service interruptions or unavailability; data loss or corruption; security incidents; third-party actions or content; and damages arising from reliance on the service. These limitations reflect the experimental or low-cost nature of the service offering.
