# L8 v1.0.0

## Liability (Level 8)

### 📌 Summary
Near-complete liability disclaimer with only token acknowledgment of legal minimums.

### 👤 What This Means For You
This level approaches a complete liability disclaimer while acknowledging that some jurisdictions may not permit total disclaimers. The service is provided with the understanding that users bear essentially all risk. This is typically used for free services, experimental projects, or situations where the provider cannot reasonably guarantee any particular outcome. Users should treat this as effectively having no recourse and should not use the service for anything they cannot afford to lose.

### 📜 Legal Text
To the fullest extent permitted by law, Provider's liability is limited to the minimum amount required by applicable law, if any. The service is provided "as is" and "as available" without any warranties whatsoever. Provider disclaims all liability for any damages of any kind, including but not limited to: direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, and special damages; loss of use, data, profits, or business opportunities; and any claims by third parties. Where jurisdictions do not allow complete disclaimers, liability is limited to the minimum extent permitted. User expressly assumes all risks.
