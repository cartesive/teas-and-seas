# L9 v1.0.0

## Liability (Level 9)

### 📌 Summary
We disclaim all liability completely - use at your own risk with zero recourse.

### 👤 What This Means For You
This represents a complete liability disclaimer typically used for experimental software, open-source projects, or high-risk tools where users must accept full responsibility. This level is appropriate when the service is provided free of charge, is clearly experimental, or involves inherent risks that users must evaluate themselves. The comprehensive disclaimer ensures that experimental or volunteer-maintained projects can be offered without exposing creators to liability for unintended outcomes. Users should carefully consider whether this risk level is appropriate for their use case.
