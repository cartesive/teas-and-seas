# L7 v1.0.0

## Liability (Level 7)

### 📌 Summary
Extremely limited liability capped at $10 with comprehensive exclusions and no warranties.

### 👤 What This Means For You
This liability level is designed for very low-cost or experimental services where the business model cannot support meaningful liability coverage. The $10 cap represents a token acknowledgment of potential issues while making clear that users should not rely on the service for critical purposes. This is appropriate for hobby projects, educational tools, or services operating on minimal budgets where users understand they're essentially using the service at their own risk.
