# L5 v1.0.0

## Liability (Level 5)

### 📌 Summary
Our liability is limited to what you paid us in the last 12 months, and we exclude certain types of damages.

### 👤 What This Means For You
If something goes wrong, we'll take responsibility up to the amount you've paid us in the past year. We won't cover lost profits or other indirect damages, but we will address direct issues with our service. This is a common middle-ground approach used by many businesses.

### 📜 Legal Text
Our total liability for any claims arising from this agreement shall not exceed the amount paid by you to us in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. We shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including lost profits, data loss, or business interruption. This limitation applies regardless of the theory of liability, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise.
