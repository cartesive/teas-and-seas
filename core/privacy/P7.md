# P7 v1.0.0

## Privacy (Level 7)

### 📌 Summary
We aggressively collect data, monetize it extensively, share broadly, and provide minimal user control.

### 👤 What This Means For You
We collect everything we can about you through our service and buy additional data from other companies. We use this to make money through advertising, data sales, and partnerships. Your options to control this are very limited, and using our service means accepting extensive tracking.

### 📜 Legal Text
We implement comprehensive data collection encompassing all user interactions, device information, location data, communications, and third-party enrichment. Data is monetized through advertising, direct sales, partnerships, and derivative products. We maintain broad sharing rights with affiliates, partners, acquirers, and commercial entities. User consent to collection is assumed through service use. Privacy controls are limited to legal minimums.
