# P8 v1.0.0

## Privacy (Level 8)

### 📌 Summary
We collect maximum data, claim broad rights, share globally, and offer negligible privacy protections.

### 👤 What This Means For You
We track and store everything possible, claim ownership-like rights to your data, and share it worldwide with few restrictions. Privacy laws might give you some rights, but we'll make them as hard as possible to exercise. Your data may be used in ways you never imagined.

### 📜 Legal Text
We assert maximum collection rights over all data, communications, content, metadata, and derived information. Our license to user data is perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, and transferable worldwide. Data sharing includes any entity for any purpose we deem beneficial. We claim trade secret and proprietary rights in aggregated user data. Legal privacy rights are acknowledged but subject to verification, processing fees, and technical limitations.
