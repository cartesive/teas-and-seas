## Warranty (Level 6)

### 📌 Summary
Minimal warranty - very limited guarantees with significant disclaimers and minimal remedies.

### 👤 What This Means For You
We make minimal promises about the service. While we intend for it to work, we don't guarantee specific functionality, uptime, or fitness for your needs. If issues arise, our obligations are very limited - typically just attempting basic fixes with no guarantee of success or timeline.

### 📜 Legal Text
We provide only a limited warranty that the service will be accessible and operable in material respects for 30 days. This warranty is void if you use the service beyond documented parameters. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES ARE DISCLAIMED. Your sole remedy is our discretionary effort to restore access. We make no warranties regarding accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness. The service is substantially provided "as is."
