# W3 v1.0.0

## Warranty (Level 3)

### 📌 Summary
Moderate warranty - core functions work with industry-standard limitations and remedies.

### 👤 What This Means For You
The essential features will work as generally described, though perfect operation isn't guaranteed. We'll make reasonable efforts to fix significant issues, but remedies are limited to repair attempts or partial credits. Some features may have bugs or limitations that won't qualify for warranty coverage.

### 📜 Legal Text
We warrant that the core functionality will substantially perform as described in the primary documentation for 180 days. Your sole remedy for warranty claims is our reasonable efforts to repair or replace non-conforming features. Refunds, if any, are limited to fees paid in the 90 days prior to the claim. We disclaim warranties for third-party integrations, user-generated content, and non-essential features.
