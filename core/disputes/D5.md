# D5 v1.0.0

## Disputes (Level 5)

### 📌 Summary
Mandatory arbitration for individual claims, class action waiver, but reasonable procedures.

### 👤 What This Means For You
If we have a dispute, you'll need to use arbitration instead of court for most issues. You can't join class action lawsuits, but the arbitration process is fair with standard rules. Small claims court is still available, and the arbitration happens in a reasonable location.

### 📜 Legal Text

Arbitration occurs in the nearest major city to user. Prevailing party may recover reasonable attorneys' fees.
