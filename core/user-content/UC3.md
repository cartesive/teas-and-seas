## User Content (Level 3)

### 📌 Summary
You own content but grant standard platform license for operations and moderate enhancements.

### 👤 What This Means For You
While you keep ownership, you give us reasonable permissions to run the platform effectively. This includes displaying your content as you direct, making it searchable if public, creating previews, and using aggregated insights to build better features. Your private content stays private.

### 📜 Legal Text

Public content may be indexed and displayed in platform features. License is revocable but cached/backup copies may persist temporarily.
