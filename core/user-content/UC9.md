# UC9 v1.0.0

## User Content (Level 9)

### 📌 Summary
We claim extremely broad, perpetual rights to your content including ownership-like provisions.

### 👤 What This Means For You
By uploading anything, you give us nearly unlimited rights to use your content forever, even after you delete your account. We can sell it, modify it, use it for AI training, create products from it, or transfer these rights to others. You might even lose the right to use your own content elsewhere.

### 📜 Legal Text
User grants Provider an irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable, sublicensable license with rights equivalent to ownership for all content. Rights include unlimited use, reproduction, modification, adaptation, publication, translation, distribution, public display, performance, commercialization, and creation of derivative works. Provider may assert ownership, file patents/copyrights, and restrict user's use of their own content. License explicitly survives termination indefinitely.
