# UC7 v1.0.0

## User Content (Level 7)

### 📌 Summary
Near-total content rights transfer with perpetual commercial exploitation allowed.

### 👤 What This Means For You
Uploading content gives us almost complete control over it forever. We can sell it, claim credit for it, prevent you from using it elsewhere, and transfer these rights to anyone. You keep technical ownership but lose most practical control. Think carefully before uploading anything valuable.

### 📜 Legal Text
User grants Provider a perpetual, irrevocable, exclusive in some fields, worldwide license approaching full assignment of rights. Provider may: claim authorship, register copyrights, commercially exploit without compensation, create competing works, restrict user's own use, and transfer all rights freely. License explicitly survives account termination forever. User waives all moral rights and agrees to assist in enforcement against third parties.
