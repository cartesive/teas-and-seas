# S7 v1.0.0

## Severability (Level 7)

### 📌 Summary
Extreme severability - agreement survives with unilateral modification rights.

### 👤 What This Means For You
Not only do invalid parts get removed, but the provider can unilaterally modify other parts to maintain the agreement's overall effect. You're agreeing that the provider can rewrite sections as needed to keep the agreement enforceable across different jurisdictions and circumstances.

### 📜 Legal Text
All provisions are independently severable. Provider may unilaterally modify any provision to ensure enforceability while maintaining substantial equivalence. Invalid provisions trigger automatic application of provider's standard fallback terms. User waives objection to reasonable modifications necessary for enforceability. Severability determinations are made on jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.
