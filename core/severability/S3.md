# S3 v1.0.0

## Severability (Level 3)

### 📌 Summary
Moderate severability - invalid parts removed with court reformation option.

### 👤 What This Means For You
If any part is invalid, it's removed and the rest continues. Courts may rewrite invalid provisions to make them enforceable while staying close to the original intent. This balanced approach keeps the agreement functional while respecting legal limits.

### 📜 Legal Text
If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force. The court is authorized to reform any invalid provision to the minimum extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable while preserving the original intent to the greatest extent possible.
