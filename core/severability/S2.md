# S2 v1.0.0

## Severability (Level 2)

### 📌 Summary
Limited severability - invalid parts removed unless they affect major sections.

### 👤 What This Means For You
Invalid provisions are removed and the rest of the agreement continues. However, if an invalid provision is central to a major section (like payment or liability), that entire section may need to be renegotiated. The agreement survives but may need amendments.

### 📜 Legal Text
Invalid or unenforceable provisions shall be severed from this agreement. If such provision is integral to a major section, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to replace it with a valid provision achieving similar purposes. If agreement cannot be reached within 30 days, either party may terminate the affected section while maintaining the remainder of the agreement.
