# S1 v1.0.0

## Severability (Level 1)

### 📌 Summary
Minimal severability - invalid parts removed, but core purpose must remain.

### 👤 What This Means For You
If a court finds any part of these terms invalid, only that specific part is removed. However, if removing that part fundamentally changes the agreement's purpose, the entire agreement may fail. Most of the agreement stays in effect unless the invalid part was essential.

### 📜 Legal Text
If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall continue in effect, provided that striking such provision does not materially alter the fundamental purpose of this agreement. If the fundamental purpose is materially altered, the entire agreement shall terminate.

### 🔍 Examples
- Agreements with core essential terms
- Services with specific primary purposes
- Contracts needing basic integrity
