## 📝 How to Contribute

### For Clause Contributions

1. **Check existing work**: Review current clauses to understand the pattern
2. **Follow the template**:
```markdown
# [CODE][LEVEL] v1.0.0

## [Type] (Level [number])

### 📌 Summary
[One-line plain English summary]

### 👤 What This Means For You

- [Real-world example 2]

---
*Version History*

```

3. **Remember the scale**:
   - Level 0: Maximum user benefit, most freedom
   - Level 5: Balanced, industry standard
   - Level 9: Maximum business protection, most restrictive

4. **Keep language consistent**: Match the tone and style of existing clauses

### For All Contributions

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b add-payment-levels-2-4`
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Commit with clear messages**: `git commit -m "Add Payment levels 2, 3, and 4"`
5. **Push to your fork**: `git push origin add-payment-levels-2-4`
6. **Open a Pull Request** with:

## 🤔 What Makes a Good Contribution?

### ✅ Good Clauses
- **Clear**: Understandable by non-lawyers
- **Practical**: Based on real-world usage
- **Graduated**: Fits logically in the 0-9 scale
- **Complete**: Includes all template sections
- **Fair**: Honestly represents what users are agreeing to

### ❌ Avoid
- **Deceptive language**: Don't hide important terms
- **Extreme positions**: Even level 9 should be legally reasonable
- **Copying verbatim**: Create original text, don't copy-paste from existing T&Cs
- **Jurisdiction-specific**: Keep core clauses universal (use `/jurisdictions/` for local variations)

## 💬 Getting Help

- **Questions?** Open an issue labeled "question"
- **Discuss ideas** before major work - we're happy to guide you
- **Legal uncertainty?** Flag it - we embrace transparency about limitations

## 🎯 Priority Areas

Current high-priority needs:
1. Intermediate levels for existing sections
2. Security (SEC) and Third Party (TP) sections
3. Industry-specific examples (SaaS, e-commerce, mobile)
4. Jurisdiction adaptations for EU, California, UK
5. Tools for generating complete T&C documents
