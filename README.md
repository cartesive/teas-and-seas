A set of Terms and Conditions (T's and C's) that are easy to use, and fair for your customers.

## What is it, and why?

*Terms and Conditions are a pain, and nobody reads them anyway.*

It takes too long to read terms and conditions, and they are not well understood. This collection of universal, pre-written T's&C's are designed to be easy to assemble and easy to consume.

Developers know their software licenses by shorthand acronyms, like MIT, GPL, BSD, etc. These are generally well understood because they are consitent across projects and their intent is known eve without re-reading the text.

## How to use

Each of the T's and C's sections are ordered in levels from one to nine. 

Just browse through the texts and use the ones you need.

There are high-level, single-letter sections which are designed to be best for general understanding and use. These are simply a combination of all of the subsections at the same level.

For instance, you could include Privacy collection level one (PC1), privacy discosure level one (PD1), etc. But if all your Privacy terms are at level one, just use P1.
