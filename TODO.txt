## Critical Updates Needed

1. **Fix Tone and Neutrality Issues**
   - Review all existing clauses (especially PAY7-PAY9, L7-L9, etc.) for inflammatory language
   - Remove terms like "predatory," "exploitation," "aggressive," "traps"
   - Add business context explaining why stricter terms might be necessary
   - Ensure examples reference legitimate business needs, not assume malicious intent
   - Maintain neutral, factual tone throughout all clause levels

## Implementation Plan

1. **Restructure Repository Architecture**
   - Create clear directory structure (core/, jurisdictions/, examples/, tools/)
   - Set up versioning system for clauses
   - Establish naming conventions and file organization

2. **Define and Draft All T&C Sections**
   - Identify all needed sections (Privacy, Terms of Use, Warranty, Liability, Payment, User Content, Intellectual Property, Disputes, etc.)
   - Create version 0 drafts for each section at each level (0-9)
   - Establish consistent structure: Summary → Plain English → Legal Text
   - Define what each level means across all sections

3. **Complete Core Clause Library**
   - Fill out all levels (0-9) for each clause type
   - Create both plain language and legal versions
   - Add icon/emoji summaries for each level

4. **Build Contribution Framework**
   - Write CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines
   - Create pull request templates
   - Set up issue templates for proposals/improvements
   - Establish RFC-style proposal process

5. **Develop Legal Commons Documentation**
   - Create LEGAL_COMMONS.md explaining the philosophy
   - Write "Why Contribute" guide for lawyers
   - Set up CONTRIBUTORS.md for recognition
   - Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

6. **Create Usage Tools**
   - Build simple static site generator for T&C documents
   - Create badge generator (SVG/PNG)
   - Develop compatibility checker script
   - Add examples of complete T&C documents

7. **Establish Validation Process**
   - Create review checklist for new clauses
   - Set up peer review workflow
   - Add jurisdiction compatibility notes
   - Create testing/example scenarios

8. **Build Community Infrastructure**
   - Expand README with clear project vision
   - Create GitHub Discussions categories
   - Set up project website (GitHub Pages)
   - Write onboarding guides for different audiences

## Other Ideas

- **Metadata System**: Create JSON metadata files for each section (e.g., privacy_meta.json) that explain what each level (0-9) specifically means for that clause type
