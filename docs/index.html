This is a common middle-ground approach used by many businesses.\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Legal Text\nOur total liability for any claims arising from this agreement shall not exceed the amount paid by you to us in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

The nominal liability cap reflects the experimental nature or low-cost model of these services. While we strive to provide value, the limited warranty acknowledges that experimental or donation-based services cannot promise the same reliability as premium offerings. This allows innovative services to exist that might not be viable under traditional liability models.\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Legal Text\nMaximum aggregate liability shall not exceed the lesser of $50 or fees paid in the preceding month. Service is provided \"as is\" and \"as available\" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. Provider's liability excludes: all categories of damages; service interruptions or unavailability; data loss or corruption; security incidents; third-party actions or content; and damages arising from reliance on the service. These limitations reflect the experimental or low-cost nature of the service offering.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Examples\n- Free services with optional donations\n- Beta/experimental features\n- Community-run services\n\n---\n*Version History*\n- v1.0.0 - Initial version",

The $10 cap represents a token acknowledgment of potential issues while making clear that users should not rely on the service for critical purposes. This is appropriate for hobby projects, educational tools, or services operating on minimal budgets where users understand they're essentially using the service at their own risk.\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Legal Text\nProvider's total aggregate liability arising from or related to this agreement shall not exceed $10 USD. Service is provided strictly \"as is\" without any warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Provider expressly disclaims liability for: any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages; loss of data, profits, revenue, or business opportunities; service interruptions or failures; third-party claims; or any damages resulting from reliance on the service.

The service is provided with the understanding that users bear essentially all risk. This is typically used for free services, experimental projects, or situations where the provider cannot reasonably guarantee any particular outcome. Users should treat this as effectively having no recourse and should not use the service for anything they cannot afford to lose.\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Legal Text\nTo the fullest extent permitted by law, Provider's liability is limited to the minimum amount required by applicable law, if any. The service is provided \"as is\" and \"as available\" without any warranties whatsoever. Provider disclaims all liability for any damages of any kind, including but not limited to: direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, and special damages; loss of use, data, profits, or business opportunities; and any claims by third parties. Where jurisdictions do not allow complete disclaimers, liability is limited to the minimum extent permitted.

This level is appropriate when the service is provided free of charge, is clearly experimental, or involves inherent risks that users must evaluate themselves. The comprehensive disclaimer ensures that experimental or volunteer-maintained projects can be offered without exposing creators to liability for unintended outcomes. Users should carefully consider whether this risk level is appropriate for their use case.\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Legal Text\nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Provider disclaims all liability of any kind. The service is provided \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. Provider shall not be liable for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation: direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, special, or exemplary damages; or any damages for loss of use, data, profits, business opportunities, or goodwill, regardless of whether Provider has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Provider may unilaterally modify any provision to ensure enforceability while maintaining substantial equivalence. Invalid provisions trigger automatic application of provider's standard fallback terms. User waives objection to reasonable modifications necessary for enforceability. Severability determinations are made on jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Examples\n- Global platforms with jurisdiction variations\n- Services with complex regulatory requirements\n- High-risk operational environments\n\n---\n*Version History*\n- v1.0.0 - Initial version",

The provider has ongoing rights to modify, replace, or restructure any part of the agreement to maintain enforceability. You're essentially agreeing to whatever version remains enforceable in your jurisdiction, even if substantially different from what you originally read.\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Legal Text\nMaximum severability applies at word, phrase, sentence, and section levels. Provider reserves perpetual right to modify, replace, or restructure any portion to maintain enforceability. User agrees to be bound by any resulting enforceable configuration. Automated jurisdiction-detection may apply different terms. User waives notice of minor modifications for enforceability.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Examples\n- Platforms operating under sanctions\n- Services navigating hostile regulatory environments\n- Experimental legal structures\n\n---\n*Version History*\n- v1.0.0 - Initial version",

Any part can be severed, modified, or replaced at any time, even retroactively. The agreement shape-shifts as needed to remain enforceable. You're bound by whatever configuration survives legal challenges, regardless of changes from the original.\n\n### \ud83d\udcdc Legal Text\nAbsolute severability at all granular levels with retroactive effect. Provider may modify any aspect preemptively or responsively to ensure enforceability. Agreement automatically conforms to most restrictive enforceable interpretation in each jurisdiction. User irrevocably consents to all modifications necessary for enforceability, including fundamental restructuring. Waives all notice rights.\n\n### \ud83d\udd0d Examples\n- Services facing existential legal threats\n- Platforms in legally uncertain domains\n- Maximum flexibility requirements\n\n---\n*Version History*\n- v1.0.0 - Initial version"
