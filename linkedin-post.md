# LinkedIn Post: Reviving Open Source with Claude Code Opus

## Post Content

I recently used Claude Code Opus to complete work on an abandoned open source project called Teas and Seas, with interesting results.

**About the Project**
Teas and Seas is a Legal Commons initiative that aims to standardize Terms & Conditions clauses using numbered levels (0-9), similar to how software licenses work with MIT, GPL, etc. The goal is to make legal terms more transparent and comparable across services.

**The Situation**
The project had been incomplete for months. Multiple clause types were missing most of their levels, documentation was inconsistent, and there were no clear usage examples.

**What We Accomplished**
Working with Claude Code Opus over several sessions, we completed:

- 28 new legal clause files across Termination, User Content, Payment, and Warranty categories
- 9 complete clause types now available, each with all levels 0-9
- Updated documentation with comprehensive examples
- A badge notation system enabling quick comparison: services can display something like P2•L4•W2•PAY2•UC1•T2•AU3

**The Process**
Claude Code Opus handled the legal nuances well, maintaining consistency across complex documentation and following established patterns. Each clause includes a summary, plain English explanation, formal legal text, and usage examples.

**Practical Result**
Instead of hiring lawyers or copying unclear terms, a startup can now select appropriate levels for each clause type and users can understand service terms at a glance.

**Broader Observation**
This experience suggests that AI tools can be effective for reviving stalled open source projects, particularly those requiring consistent documentation across many similar files.

## Alternative Shorter Version

Used Claude Code Opus to complete an abandoned Legal Commons project called Teas and Seas.

**Before:** Incomplete T&C standardization system with missing documentation  
**After:** 28 new legal clause files, 9 complete clause types, comprehensive examples

The system lets startups use notation like P2•L5•W1•T1 to specify their terms, making legal agreements more transparent and comparable.

Useful demonstration of AI tools for completing stalled documentation projects.
