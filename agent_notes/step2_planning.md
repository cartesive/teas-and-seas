## Questions Before Proceeding:

1. Should we include additional sections like:
   - **Cookies (C)** - Separate from Privacy?
   - **Accessibility (A)** - ADA/WCAG compliance?
   - **Age Requirements (AGE)** - COPPA/age restrictions?
   - **Export Control (EX)** - International restrictions?

2. For existing partial files:
   - Should I preserve the current content and structure?
   - Or rewrite to match the new template?

3. Level philosophy:
   - Should level 0 always mean "not applicable" or could it mean "unrestricted"?
   - Should we ensure levels are proportional across all sections?
