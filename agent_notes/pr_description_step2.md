### 1. **Complete Privacy Section**
First section with all 10 levels (P0-P9), demonstrating the full spectrum from "no data collection" to "aggressive tracking and monetization"

### 2. **Established Clear Patterns**
Each section now has:
- **Level 0**: Maximum user benefit (e.g., "No cookies whatsoever")
- **Level 5**: Industry standard balance (e.g., "Standard arbitration clause")
- **Level 9**: Maximum business protection (e.g., "We own your content forever")

### 3. **Consistent Template Format**
Every clause follows the structure:
```markdown
# [CODE][LEVEL] v1.0.0
## [Type] (Level [N])
### 📌 Summary
### 👤 What This Means For You  
### 📜 Legal Text
### 🔍 Examples
```

### 4. **Real-World Examples**
Each clause includes concrete examples to help users understand when they might encounter these terms

## 📝 Notable Clause Examples

### Most User-Friendly (Level 0)
- **P0**: "We don't collect any data whatsoever"
- **L0**: "We accept full liability for our service"
- **PAY0**: "Completely free - no payment ever required"
- **D0**: "Keep all legal rights, sue in local courts"

### Industry Standard (Level 5)  
- **P5**: "Collect necessary data, use analytics, don't sell personal info"
- **L5**: "Liability limited to 12 months of fees"
- **T5**: "Either party can terminate with 30 days notice"

## 🔄 Changes to Existing Files

### README.md
- Fixed broken links from old `/texts/` structure

2. Create remaining 7 sections: Security (SEC), Third Party (TP), Indemnification (I), Accessibility (A), Export Control (EX), General (G), Severability (S)
3. Update old format files to match new template

## 🧪 Testing/Validation
