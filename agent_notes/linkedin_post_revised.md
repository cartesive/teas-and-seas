# LinkedIn Post for Teas & Seas Launch (Revised)

---

I've been working on an open-source project that addresses a problem we all face: incomprehensible Terms & Conditions.

The average website's terms take 67 minutes to read and require a grade 18 reading level. Most businesses spend thousands on custom drafting, yet only 15% of users ever read them. This serves no one well.

Teas & Seas proposes a simple solution: standardized terms using a clear coding system. Just as developers understand "MIT License" without reading it each time, we envision terms expressed as "P2•L5•W1•T1" where:

- P2 = Anonymous data collection, no resale
- L5 = Standard liability limitations  
- W1 = Basic warranty provisions
- T1 = 30-day termination notice

The goal is to create a Legal Commons where businesses can assemble fair, understandable terms without starting from scratch, and users can quickly grasp what they're agreeing to.

We're seeking input from lawyers, developers, and business owners interested in making legal terms more accessible. The project is in early stages, and we welcome feedback on whether this approach could work in practice.

I'm curious about your thoughts. Could standardized terms improve transparency while still protecting business interests?

Working on an open-source approach to Terms & Conditions: standardized, coded clauses that work like software licenses.

Instead of 47 pages of custom legalese, imagine "P2•L5•W1•T1" - instantly recognizable terms that both businesses and users understand.

Early stages, seeking feedback from legal and tech communities.

Would standardized legal terms work in practice? Interested in your perspective.
