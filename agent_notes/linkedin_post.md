# LinkedIn Post for Teas & Seas Launch

---

🚀 Excited to share an open-source project that could transform how we handle Terms & Conditions!

Remember when software licenses were a mess until standards like "MIT License" emerged? We're doing the same for Terms & Conditions with **Teas & Seas**.

**The Problem:**
📊 67 minutes - Average time to read website terms
💸 $250/hour - Cost for custom T&C drafting  
📖 15% - People who actually read terms
🎓 Grade 18 - Reading level of most legal docs

**Our Solution:**
Instead of 47 pages of legalese, imagine seeing: **P2•L5•W1•T1**

Just like developers instantly understand "MIT License," anyone could understand:
- P2 = We collect anonymous data, don't sell it
- L5 = Standard liability limits
- W1 = Basic warranty
- T1 = 30-day termination notice

**Why This Matters:**
✅ Small businesses get proper legal protection without breaking the bank
✅ Users actually understand what they're agreeing to
✅ Lawyers focus on unique value, not rewriting the same privacy clause for the 100th time
✅ Terms compete on fairness, not obscurity

**We Need Your Help:**
- ⚖️ Lawyers: Review and improve standardized clauses
- 💻 Developers: Build tools and integrations
- 🏢 Business owners: Be early adopters
- 👥 Everyone: Share feedback and spread the word

This is about creating a "Legal Commons" - where clarity is strength, not weakness.

Check out the project and contribute: https://github.com/cartesive/teas-and-seas/blob/master/README.md

What do you think? Could standardized T&Cs work like open-source licenses? Would you use a service that clearly shows "P2•L5•W1" instead of hiding behind walls of text?

What if Terms & Conditions were as simple as "MIT License"? 

That's what we're building with Teas & Seas - standardized, plain-English legal terms that everyone can understand.

Instead of 47 pages of legalese → Just "P2•L5•W1•T1"

We're creating a Legal Commons where:
• Small businesses get proper terms without $250/hr lawyers
• Users actually understand what they're signing
• Clear terms become a competitive advantage
