# Pull Request: Repository Restructure & Standardized Clause Library Foundation

## 🎯 Overview
This PR implements Steps 1 and 2 from our implementation plan, establishing the foundation for the Teas & Seas standardized terms and conditions project.

## 🏗️ Major Changes

### Repository Restructure (Step 1)
- **New Directory Structure**: Organized the repository into logical sections:
  - `/core/` - Standardized T&C clauses by type
  - `/jurisdictions/` - Region-specific modifications (US, EU, CA, UK)
  - `/examples/` - Complete T&C examples (SaaS, e-commerce, mobile apps)
  - `/tools/` - Future utilities (builder, validator, badge generator)
  - `/docs/` - Documentation and guides
  - `/agent_notes/` - Development planning notes

### Clause Library Foundation (Step 2)
- **18 Clause Types Defined**: Expanded from original 4 to comprehensive set covering all major T&C needs
- **Standardized Template Format**: Consistent structure across all clauses:
  ```
  📌 Summary - One-line description
  👤 What This Means For You - Plain English explanation
  📜 Legal Text - Formal legal language
  🔍 Examples - Real-world use cases
  ```
- **Level Philosophy**: 0-9 scale where 0 = maximum user freedom, 9 = maximum business protection

## 📋 Clause Types Created

| Code | Type | Description | Files Created |
|------|------|-------------|---------------|
| P | Privacy | Data collection & sharing | P0, P1, P5, P9 |
| L | Liability | Damage limitations | L0, L5, L9 |
| AGE | Age Requirements | Age restrictions | AGE0 |
| W | Warranty | Product guarantees | Migrated |
| T | Termination | Service ending | Migrated |
| S | Severability | Invalid clauses | Migrated |
| PAY | Payment | Billing terms | Directory created |
| UC | User Content | User submissions | Directory created |
| IP | Intellectual Property | Ownership/licensing | Directory created |
| D | Disputes | Resolution methods | Directory created |
| G | General | Misc provisions | Migrated |
| C | Cookies | Tracking policies | Directory created |
| A | Accessibility | Disability support | Directory created |
| EX | Export Control | Trade restrictions | Directory created |
| AU | Acceptable Use | Prohibited activities | Directory created |
| SEC | Security | Data protection | Directory created |
| TP | Third Party | External services | Directory created |
| I | Indemnification | Hold harmless | Directory created |

## 📊 Progress
- ✅ Repository structure complete
- ✅ 8 example clause files created (showing level 0, 5, 9 patterns)
- 📝 172 clause files remaining (to complete all 180)

## 🔄 Migration Details
- Moved existing files from `/texts/` to appropriate `/core/` subdirectories
- Rewrote privacy clauses to match new standardized format
- Preserved original warranty, termination, and severability files for future updates

## 📚 Documentation Added
- `STRUCTURE.md` - Explains new repository organization
- Planning notes in `/agent_notes/` for development tracking
- Updated `TODO.txt` with metadata system idea

## 🎨 Design Decisions
1. **Emoji Icons**: Added visual indicators for better readability
2. **Version Tracking**: Each clause includes version header (e.g., `# P0 v1.0.0`)
3. **Examples Section**: Concrete use cases help users understand when to use each level
4. **Consistent Naming**: `[CODE][LEVEL].md` format (e.g., `P2.md`, `L5.md`)

## 🔮 Next Steps
- Complete remaining clause files for all levels (0-9) across all types
- Create contribution guidelines (Step 4)
- Develop Legal Commons documentation (Step 5)
- Build tools for clause assembly and validation (Step 6)

## 🧪 Testing
- Verified directory structure creation
- Confirmed file migrations preserved content
- Validated new clause format consistency
